ChangeLog:1@TwoStage.java
FixDescription: Resolve the atomicity violation in methods A and B by ensuring that updates to data1 and data2 are performed atomically. This avoids the issue where the read operation in method B could see an inconsistent state between data1 and data2.
OriginalCode@5-11:
[5]     public void A () {
[6]        synchronized (data1) {
[7]            data1.value=1;
[8]        }
[9]        synchronized (data2) {
[10]            data2.value=data1.value+1;
[11]        }
FixedCode@5-11:
[5]     public void A () {
[6]        synchronized (this) {
[7]            data1.value=1;
[8]            data2.value=data1.value+1;
[9]        }
[10]
[11]

ChangeLog:2@TwoStage.java
FixDescription: Modify the B method to prevent potential read inconsistencies by synchronizing both read operations within the same synchronized block.
OriginalCommand@14-23:
[14] 	int t1=-1, t2=-1;
[15]         synchronized (data1) {
[16] 	    if (data1.value==0) return ;
[17] 	        t1=data1.value;
[18] 	}
[19] 	synchronized (data2) {
[20] 	    t2=data2.value;
[21] 	}
[22]         if (t2 != (t1+1))
[23] 	    throw new RuntimeException("bug found");
FixedCode@14-23:
[14] 	int t1=-1, t2=-1;
[15]         synchronized (this) {
[16] 	    if (data1.value==0) return ;
[17] 	        t1=data1.value;
[18] 	    t2=data2.value;
[19] 	}
[20]         if (t2 != (t1+1))
[21] 	    throw new RuntimeException("bug found");

These changes ensure that the operations within methods A and B are performed atomically without interference from concurrent executions, while avoiding deadlocks by not using multiple locks in a nested manner.
