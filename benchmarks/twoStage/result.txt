ChangeLog:1@TwoStage.java
FixDescription: Ensure atomicity in method A to prevent atomicity violation by synchronizing the entire sequence of operations that modify data1 and data2. This prevents other threads from reading inconsistent states between the operations.
OriginalCode@5-11:
[5]     public void A () {
[6]        synchronized (data1) {
[7]            data1.value=1;
[8]        }
[9]        synchronized (data2) {   		
[10]            data2.value=data1.value+1;
[11]        }
FixedCode@5-11:
[5]     public void A () {
[6]        synchronized (this) {
[7]            data1.value=1;
[8]            data2.value=data1.value+1;
[9]        }
[10]        
[11]        

ChangeLog:2@Main.java
FixDescription: Correct the misuse of the 'run' method in the 'main' method to properly start the thread, ensuring that the threads are correctly managed and started in a separate call stack.
OriginalCode@23-23:
[23] 			t.run();
FixedCode@23-23:
[23] 			t.start();
