    "reason": "Synchronized is the only correct strategy because the defect involves a compound `act-then-check` operation (`Num_Of_Seats_Sold++` followed by an `if` condition). This entire sequence must be atomic to prevent race conditions where seats are oversold. CAS (via `AtomicInteger`) is unsuitable because it cannot atomically group the increment and the subsequent check into a single operation. Additionally, changing the type of the `package-private` field to `AtomicInteger` would be a breaking API change. Volatile is incorrect as it only guarantees visibility and provides no atomicity for the `read-modify-write` operation (`++`)."
