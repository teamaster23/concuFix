    "reason": "Synchronized was chosen because the operation on 'this.pingPongPlayer' is a compound read-modify-write action (read, set to null, then restore), which is not atomic. Correctness requires that this entire sequence is executed without interruption. CAS is unsuitable as it can only guarantee atomicity for a single operation (e.g., compare-and-set), not a multi-statement block. Volatile is also inappropriate as it only ensures visibility of the latest write but provides no atomicity guarantees, leaving the compound operation vulnerable to race conditions."
