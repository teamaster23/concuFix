    "reason": "The operations on `this.t.turn` constitute a compound `check-then-act` pattern (e.g., `if(t.turn != 0)` and `while(t.turn != 1)`), which is not intrinsically atomic. Correctness demands that the entire sequence be executed atomically, making `synchronized` the only safe choice. A higher-priority CAS strategy is unsuitable because it cannot atomically protect a multi-statement block. A `volatile` strategy is also incorrect because, while it ensures visibility, it fails to provide the atomicity required to prevent race conditions in a check-then-act sequence. The lock must be placed on the shared object `this.t` itself, as it is the instance whose `turn` field is being contended by multiple threads."
