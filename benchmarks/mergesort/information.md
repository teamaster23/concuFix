    "reason": "The operations on `m_iCurrentThreadsAlive` (e.g., `++`, `+=`) are simple read-modify-write operations. The optimal strategy is `CAS` using `AtomicInteger`, which provides atomic methods like `incrementAndGet()` and `addAndGet()`. This approach is more performant than `synchronized` locking. Because the field is `private`, changing its type from `int` to `AtomicInteger` is a safe, non-breaking refactoring. `volatile` was rejected because it only ensures visibility and cannot guarantee atomicity for the compound read-modify-write actions."
