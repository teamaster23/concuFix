SetCheck.java:20: warning: Thread Safety Violation 2
  Read/Write race. Non-private method `SetCheck.check()` reads without synchronization from `this.b`. Potentially races with write in method `SetCheck.set()`.
 Reporting because the current class is annotated `@ThreadSafe`, so we assume that this method can run in parallel with other non-private methods in the class (including itself).
