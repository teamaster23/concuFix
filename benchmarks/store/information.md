    "reason": "The optimal strategy is CAS. The operation `customerCost += cost` is a non-atomic `read-modify-write` operation. An `AtomicInteger` can handle this specific compound action atomically using its `addAndGet()` method. Since the target variable `customerCost` is `private`, its type can be changed to `AtomicInteger` without a breaking API change, making this a safe and highly efficient lock-free approach. `synchronized` would also be correct but incurs higher overhead. `volatile` is incorrect because it only ensures visibility, not atomicity, and would not prevent the race condition."
