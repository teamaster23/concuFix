  Read/Write race. Non-private method `Store.consume(...)` reads without synchronization from `this.customerCost`. Potentially races with write in method `Store.consume(...)`.
 Reporting because the current class is annotated `@ThreadSafe`, so we assume that this method can run in parallel with other non-private methods in the class (including itself).
