  Method 1: int getBalance()
      Line 8: return this.balance;

  Method 2: void setBalance(int balance)
      Line 12: this.balance = balance;

  Variable to protect: this.balance (private int balance; at line 5)

  Recommended strategy: CAS (using AtomicInteger)

  We are to change:
    - The variable declaration from `private int balance;` to `private AtomicInteger balance;`
    - The getBalance method to return the value from the AtomicInteger (using get())
    - The setBalance method to set the value of the AtomicInteger (using set())

  Important: Initialize AtomicInteger with new AtomicInteger(0) in the constructor? 
  But note: the problem says "When using AtomicInteger, ALWAYS initialize it with: new AtomicInteger(0)".

  However, note that the current code does not have a constructor. We are only to fix the methods and the variable.

  But note: the variable is currently declared as `private i

- Method 2: (we are not given a second method name, but the problem says "two methods", and the related events only show setBalance. However, note that the problem says "two methods" but the provided events only show one method. We must assume that the second method is the one that uses the balance, but the problem does not specify. However, the problem states: "Analyze the two methods below", but in the provided code we only see one method? Let me re-read the problem.

But note: the problem says "Method 1 and Method 2 below", but in the actual code we are to fix, we are only given the variable and the setBalance method. However, the problem states that there are two methods. Since the problem does not provide the second method, we must assume that the second method is the one that is missing? But wait, the problem says:
