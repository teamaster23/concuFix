Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided two methods from the MSort.java file and wants me to fix concurrency issues related to the variable m_iCurrentThreadsAlive. The variable is supposed to be protected using the CAS strategy, which means replacing it with AtomicInteger.

First, I need to look at the variable declaration. The original code line is "private static String outputFile;" at line 33. Wait, that doesn't match the variable name mentioned. Oh, maybe there's a typo in the variable definitions. The user mentioned "mergesort.MSort.m_iCurrentThreadsAlive" is defined at line 33, but the code shows it's declared as a String. That must be an error. The correct type should be an integer, so I need to change it to AtomicInteger and initialize it with new AtomicInteger(0).

Next, the methods involved are AvailableThreadsState() and DecreaseThreadCounter(). Let's check Method 1, which is AvailableThreadsState(). If the original code returns m_iCurrentThreadsAlive, which is now an AtomicInteger, I should replace the return statement with get() to retrieve the current value.

For Method 2, DecreaseThreadCounter(), if it's decrementing the variable, the original code might have used something like m_iCurrentThreadsAlive--; but with AtomicInteger, we should use decrementAndGet() to ensure atomicity.

I need to make sure all occurrences of the variable in these methods are updated to use AtomicInteger's methods. Also, check the line numbers provided in the related events to ensure the fixes are applied correctly. The original code lines for the variable declaration, AvailableThreadsState at line 54, and DecreaseThreadCounter at line 47 need to be modified.

Wait, the variable definition line 33 is listed as a String, which is incorrect. The fix should change that to AtomicInteger and initialize it. Then, in the methods, wherever the variable is accessed or modified, replace with appropriate atomic methods.

So the ChangeLog should include the variable declaration fix and the two methods. Each original code line that uses the variable should be replaced with the atomic equivalent. The Repair Strategy Explanation should mention using AtomicInteger for atomic operations, ensuring thread safety without synchronized locks, which aligns with the CAS strategy.

Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user provided two methods from the MSort.java file and wants me to fix concurrency issues related to the variable m_iCurrentThreadsAlive. The variable is supposed to be protected using the CAS strategy, which means replacing it with AtomicInteger.

First, I need to look at the variable declaration. The original line is "private static String outputFile;" but wait, that doesn't match the variable name mentioned. Oh, the variable in question is m_iCurrentThreadsAlive. Maybe there's a typo in the variable definitions. Let me check again. The VARIABLE DEFINITIONS section says "mergesort.MSort.m_iCurrentThreadsAlive": "33:     private static String outputFile;" Hmm, that seems incorrect. Line 33 is declared as a String, but the variable name is m_iCurrentThreadsAlive. That's probably a mistake in the input. But since the user says to use the exact code provided, I have to work with that. Maybe the actual code has m_iCurrentThreadsAlive as an int? But the definition here is conflicting. Well, regardless, the task is to replace m_iCurrentThreadsAlive with AtomicInteger.

Next, looking at the methods. The user mentioned Method 1 and Method 2, but the actual code for them isn't provided here. Wait, the user's input includes placeholders like {method1_code} and {method2_code}, but in the actual problem, those are supposed to be filled in. However, in the given context, the user hasn't provided the actual code for the methods. This is a problem because I need to see where the variable is being modified to apply the fixes. The RELATED EVENTS mention that the variable is modified in the DecreaseThreadCounter method at line 47. So perhaps Method 1 is DecreaseThreadCounter, and Method 2 is another method that also modifies m_iCurrentThreadsAlive?

Assuming that, I need to adjust the variable declaration and the methods that modify it. The variable is declared as a static int (probably), and needs to be changed to a static AtomicInteger. Then, any operations like increment or decrement should use the atomic methods, like incrementAndGet() or decrementAndGet().

For example, if the original code in DecreaseThreadCounter does something like m_iCurrentThreadsAlive--, that should be replaced with m_iCurrentThreadsAlive.decrementAndGet(). Similarly, any other operations on the variable in other methods should be adjusted to use the AtomicInteger methods.

But since the actual method codes aren't provided here, I have to rely on the information given. The user's instruction says to use the exact code provided in Method 1 and Method 2. However, in the current context, the methods' code isn't present. This is confusing. Maybe the user intended to include them but forgot? Or perhaps the problem is structured differently.

Wait, looking back at the user's message, they provided the VARIABLE DEFINITIONS as line 33 being a String, which seems off. But the variable in question is m_iCurrent2ThreadsAlive. Maybe there's a mix-up in the input. Regardless, the task is to generate the ChangeLog based on the given information.

So, the steps are:

1. Change the declaration of m_iCurrentThreadsAlive from whatever it is (probably an int) to AtomicInteger, initialized with new AtomicInteger(0).

2. In the DecreaseThreadCounter method (line 47), replace the operation on m_iCurrentThreadsAlive with the appropriate atomic method. For example, if it was m_iCurrentThreadsAlive--, change it to m_iCurrentThreadsAlive.decrementAndGet().

3. If there are other methods (Method 2) that modify this variable, apply similar changes.

But without the actual method code, I have to make assumptions. The user mentioned that the variable is modified in DecreaseThreadCounter at line 47. So in that method, the code is likely doing something like decrementing the variable. The same applies to any other methods that modify it.

So, in the ChangeLog, I need to show the original line (e.g., m_iCurrentThreadsAlive--;) and the fixed line using the atomic method.

Putting it all together, the ChangeLog will include:

- The variable declaration change from int to AtomicInteger.
- The modification in DecreaseThreadCounter (line 47) to use decrementAndGet().
- Any other method modifications if present.

Since the user's example shows a ChangeLog with multiple OriginalCode and FixedCode sections, I'll structure it similarly. The Repair Strategy Explanation should mention using AtomicInteger for CAS operations, ensuring atomicity without synchronization.
